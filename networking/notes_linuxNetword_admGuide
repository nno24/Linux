hostname resolution -> mapping hostnames into ip addr's.
address resolution -> for mappinng ip addresses to hw addresses.

The TCP protocol.
lies above IP.
cities are like hosts
ip addresses are like  area codes (numbers map to cities)
port numbers to local codes (numbers map to peoples individual telephones )

an individual host may support many different services, each distinguished by its own port number.

The UDP:
/etc/services in Linux: uses this file to map services to numbers
TCP port 513 is different from UDP port 513.
Example: These ports serve as access points for two different services, namely rlogin (TCP) and rwho (UPD).

The Socket Library:
Programming interface most common in the unix world:
berkly socket library. part of the lib C library.

IP address Ranges:
Privat use:
A: 10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255
B: 172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.0.0
C: 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.0
NOTE: These are not routed on the internet.


General:
Class A: 1.0.0.0 -> 127.0.0.0
Class B: 128.0.0.0 -> 191.255.0.0
Class C: 192.0.0.0 -> 233.255.255.0
Class D,E and F:
224.0.0.0 -> 254.0.0.0 Experimental use:
e.g Multicast.

Broadcast address:
Where all bits of the host part are 1.
e.g 149.76.255.255 is not a valid host, but
referst to all hosts on network 149.76.0.0

0.0.0.0 = default route.
127.0.0.0 loopback address.
127.0.0.1 usually loopback interface.
Any IP packet handed to this interface from TCP or UDP will be returned to them as if it had just arrived from some network.

"When ARP wants to find the Ethernet address corresponding to a given IP address, it uses an Ethernet feature
called broadcasting, in which a datagram is addressed to all stations on the network simultaneously. The
broadcast datagram sent by ARP contains a query for the IP address. Each receiving host compares this query
to its own IP address and if it matches, returns an ARP reply to the inquiring host. The inquiring host can
now extract the sender's Ethernet address from the reply".

RARP - reverse address resolution protocol
& bootp protocol:
"serves to define a procedure for bootstrapping diskless clients over the network".

IP ROUTING:
autonomous systesm.
by default: The destination network is derived from the network from the network part of the IP address.

Gateways:
A gateway is a host that is connected to two or more physical networks simultaneously and is configured to switch packets between them.
-A gateway must be assigned one IP address for each network it belongs to.

Example:
eth0  149.76.4.1  255.255.255.0
fddi0 149.76.1.1  255.255.255.0
lo    127.0.0.1   255.0.0.0

THE ROUTING TABLE
IP uses a table that associates network with the gateways by wich they may be reached.
Default route: 0.0.0.0; all distination addresses match
to this route, since none of the 32 bits are required to match, and therefore packets to an unknown network are sent through the default route. 

when routing datagrams, one should always choose the route that has the largest netmask ( means a more narrow network).

Example:
Network     Netmask        Gateway    Interface
149.76.1.0  255.255.255.0  -          fddi0
149.76.2.0  255.255.255.0  149.76.1.2 fddi0
149.76.3.0  255.255.255.0  149.76.1.3 fddi0
149.76.4.0  255.255.255.0  -          fddi0
149.76.5.0  255.255.255.0  149.76.1.5 fddi0
&           &              &          &
0.0.0.0     0.0.0.0        149.76.1.2 fddi0

The only datagrams that will be routed via the default route are those that don't match any other route.

Protocols: 
RIP ( routing information protocol) for interna routnig.
BGP (border gatweay protocol), EGP (external gateway protocol)...->external routing protocols

Metric Values---
we depend on dynamis routing to chosse the best route to a destination host or network based on the number of "hops". 
Hops = gatewas a datagram has to pass before reaching a host or network.
The shorter route is, the better RIP rates it. Routes longer than 16 hops are regarded as unusable and discarded.

ICMP---The internet control message protocol
communication error messages to other hosts.
ICMP Redirect message: generated by the routing module when it detects that another host is using it as a gateway, even though a much shorter route exists.

RESOLVING HOSTNAMES = hostname resolution
ip address -> hostname
lib functions: gethostbyname(3), gethostbyaddr(3)
grouped in a separate library called resolverlibrary on Linux.
part of the standrad libc.
Usually kept in /etc/hosts file. File must be updated if changes to a LAN.
NIS stors the hosts file in a database on a master.
DNS servers are the solution on the internet.
